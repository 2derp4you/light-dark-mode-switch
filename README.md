# Light-Dark mode switch
## How to use

To use the switch in your own projects copy the div with the "border-button" class from the "App.js" file.
(Make shure to include the contents)

All the styling for the switch is in the "App.css" file and all the colors is set in the ":root".
To fit the button change the width of the button-border element and the aspect ratio will do the rest.
